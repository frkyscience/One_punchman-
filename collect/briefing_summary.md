# One punch man Briefing summary.
Elo system implementation for One Punch man.



## Hero Registration System
We require a robust registration form that captures the essence of our heroes. This form must delve beyond mere statistics and into the very spirit of what makes a hero. It will include:

Personal Information: To connect the hero with their deeds and accolades.
Hero Background: To understand the journey that has shaped their resolve.
Powers and Abilities: To gauge the potential within and the promise they hold.
Experience and Achievements: To honor past valor and inspire future glory.
Physical and Psychological Assessment: To ensure readiness for the trials ahead.



## Classes
Hero Classes: Heroes are categorized into four classes: S-Class (the elite), A-Class (the proficient), B-Class (the skilled), and C-Class (the entry-level). Each class has its own hierarchy, with heroes striving to climb the ranks.

 While the existing rankings are based on hero achievements, public perception, and contributions to society, the ELO system will be a more dynamic and competitive ranking based on duel outcomes.s

## threat levels
The Hero Association classifies threats into five categories: Wolf, Tiger, Demon, Dragon, and God, each indicating the potential danger and necessary response level.

### First we start with the registration 
It will be a two-part form 
First the registration of the lega information will take place

## ELO system implementation
Newly registered heroes will undergo a one-month probationary period.
 Upon completion of the probation period, heroes will be assigned an initial ELO rating, typically starting at 1200 points. 
 A digital system to  automate the assignment of initial ELO ratings and ensure the integrity of rating adjustments post-duel. 
 It should also provide a clear explanation of the rating system to heroes.
 To maintain a balance and prevent burnout, there will be a cap on the number of duels a hero can engage in per week.
 ### Fair Matchmaking

Heroes will be matched for duels based on their ELO ratings to ensure fair competition. This matchmaking process is crucial for the credibility of the ELO system.

### Integration with Hero Profiles
The digital system must provide real-time updates to a hero’s ELO rating and duel history


## Public Interface and Leaderboard
The public’s gaze is ever upon our heroes, and thus, a public interface is essential. It must be:

Visible and Accessible: To allow the citizens to witness the valor of their champions.
Interactive and Engaging: To foster a connection between heroes and the heart of the populace.
Secure and Respectful of Privacy: To protect those who protect us.

### Public Engagement Interface
The new interface should include a public voting system that influences the “Most Popular Hero” category. It must allow public users to access hero profiles, view their backgrounds, achievements, and duel history,

 ### Privacy and Security Measures
 
 The new system must feature dynamic data updates that reflect real-time changes in hero data, including new registrations, profile updates, and duel outcomes. Seamless navigation between the leaderboard, hero profiles, and duel information
