# Project status summary 

## DAY 4


### styling 
We`ve tried to approve and close the UX  loop with correct navbar styling and replicated that on several other HTML docs for a smooth navigation.
Also clear deciscions have been made regard the general styling of the website and giving it a cohesive feel. 



### backend
In the back end side of  things we improved the linking and data base in sync with the styling so it gets updated correctly if there is a battle or 
when there are votes given to someone their favorite hero .


### DATA
We`ve added wins so that it can be displayed and stored in the data base .



### Presentation 
We came together after our work day and gathererd in a call to make the presentation with each member of our team so everyone knows what we are going to talk about and the are on the same page. Sadly Thais and Melvyn have a obligation to make a exam English and made sure their knowlegde was shared by the team.
Weve also optimalised the program from the presentation that the ui changes in levels are easier to see.
