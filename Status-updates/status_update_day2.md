our update from what we have done so far today. 

Project Status Update
Summary:
We've made some good progress today mainly on the elo and the battle system:

we have made improvements on the elo and battle system and we are now working on combining those two toghether for an fucntioning battle system. 
further for tdoay we will be working on the front end part.
update 2: we have made it so that the elo system works and that your elo gets increased or decrreased. we have also made an fan page where people can check out there heros with an small info button wich gives a little explentation about the stats and etc. 
the main thing we will focus on for tomorrow is combineing the sepretate working things into 1 working thing.

we have also fixed our map structure its more orderd now then before wich gives us an easier way to work like this. 

if we get to combine our small projects into 1 working thing we will be able to focus more on the small details.
